      The project works for the most part, we just need to do some work to
      glue together the backend and frontend


# 13/04/2018
      This week was a bit chaotic, and we have a lot of unmerged chnages that
      should go out next week.  A lot of work that was done isn't seen in these
      commits


# 06/04/2018
      The app works! The itests now run a full end to end test, which works


# 30/03/2018
      This week we got file transfer actually working (in a non-real-world
      setting), continued integration between frontend and backend, added
      logging, and made a lot of smaller changes


# 23/03/2018
      Unsurprisingly, we didn't get much done over spring break, and are a little
      behind schedule, but we should get caught up this week


# 09/03/2018
      This week we were all a bit busy due to midterms, but accomplished most
      of what we set out to do


# 02/03/2018
      This week we made progress and stayed on schedule.  We expect that if all
      goes well we will be able to get a bit ahead of schedule next week, and
      possibly implement more in depth integration tests


# 23/02/2018
      We spent much of this week getting dev environments set up properly, and
      github/travis/code style checks/etc working
